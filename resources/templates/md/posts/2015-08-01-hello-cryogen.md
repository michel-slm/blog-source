I've been meaning to switch to a statically-generated blog for a
while, and specifically to [Cryogen](http://cryogenweb.org/) hosted on
[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), for a combination of
several reason:

* I am already writing my posts in Markdown for
  [Ghost](https://ghost.org), and prior to that,
  [Scriptogr.am](http://scriptogr.am/)
* Overhead of maintaining a Ghost blog is hosted on
  [OpenShift Online](https://www.openshift.com/products/online)
* I prefer Clojure to JavaScript
* Cryogen developer [lacarmen](https://github.com/lacarmen) is
  amazingly responsive. This
  [request for tag-specific RSS feeds](https://github.com/cryogen-project/cryogen/issues/44)
  is done within a day. Ghost dragged its feet on this.

Will set up Disqus integration later -- and need to work on a
better-looking site theme too, but that can wait. For now, hello!
